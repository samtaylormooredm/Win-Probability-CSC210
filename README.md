Overview
This project presents a win probability model for predicting college basketball game outcomes within the Atlantic 10 (A-10) conference, focusing on Davidson College and its opponents. Using historical and current-season performance data, we developed a custom-weighted scoring system based on game-level metrics like effective field goal percentage, turnover percentage, offensive rebounding percentage, and free throw rate.

A dynamic Python GUI is provided, allowing users to select two teams and predict the likely winner and their win probability. We also implemented an accuracy testing function, achieving a 73.33% prediction accuracy for the 2024â€“2025 season.
